  summary: >
    Automated task breakdown system that uses OpenAI GPT API to recursively
    decompose complex tasks into hierarchical steps. The system intelligently
    analyzes tasks and breaks them down into actionable subtasks.

    description: >
      Working prototype that uses OpenAI API to recursively break down tasks
      into subtasks. Supports configurable depth, multiple GPT models, and
      outputs results in both JSON and tree-formatted text files.
    capabilities:
      - recursive_task_breakdown via GPT API
      - configurable_recursion_depth (max_depth, gpt4_depth)
      - duplicate_step_detection
      - intermediate_results_saving
      - json_and_text_output
      - cli_interface with argparse
      - utf8_encoding_detection with chardet
  planned_state:
    description: >
      Enhanced version with better error handling, modern OpenAI API,
      structured logging, and improved architecture.
    capabilities:
      - modern_openai_api_client (v1.0+)
      - comprehensive_error_handling
      - structured_logging
      - unit_and_integration_tests
      - token_usage_tracking
      - cost_estimation
      - configuration_file_support
  nuance_notes:
    - supports_russian_language
    - recursive_depth_control
    - intermediate_results_for_debugging
    - duplicate_detection_across_hierarchy
